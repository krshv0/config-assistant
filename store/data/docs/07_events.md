ConfigurationEvents & ScriptingOn this pageEvents & ScriptingEvents and Scripting​All items can subscribe to arbitrary events; when the event happens,
all items subscribed to the event will execute their script.
This can be used to create more reactive and performant items which react to
events rather than polling for a change.sketchybar --subscribe   ... where the events are:description$INFOfront\_app\_switchedWhen the front application changes (not triggered if a different window of the same app is focused)front application namespace\_changeWhen the active mission control space changesJSON for active spaces on all displaysspace\_windows\_changeWhen a window is created or destroyed on a spaceJSON containing the space and all app windows on this spacedisplay\_changeWhen the active display is changednew active display idvolume\_changeWhen the system audio volume is changednew volume in percentbrightness\_changeWhen a displays brightness is changednew brightness in percentpower\_source\_changeWhen the devices power source is changednew power source (AC or BATTERY)wifi\_changeWhen the device connects of disconnects from wifinew WiFi SSID or empty on disconnect (not working on Sonoma)media\_changeWhen a change in now playing media is performed (experimental)media info in a JSON structuresystem\_will\_sleepWhen the system prepares to sleepsystem\_wokeWhen the system has awaken from sleepmouse.enteredWhen the mouse enters over an itemmouse.exitedWhen the mouse leaves an itemmouse.entered.globalWhen the mouse enters over any part of the barmouse.exited.globalWhen the mouse leaves all parts of the barmouse.clickedWhen an item is clickedmouse button and modifier infomouse.scrolledWhen the mouse is scrolled over an itemscroll wheel deltamouse.scrolled.globalWhen the mouse is scrolled over an empty region of the barscroll wheel deltaSome events send additional information in the $INFO variable
When an item is subscribed to these events the script is run and it gets passed the $SENDER variable, which holds exactly the above names to distinguish between the different events.
It is thus possible to have a script that reacts to each event differently e.g. via a switch for the $SENDER variable in the script.Alternatively a fixed update\_freq can be --set, such that the event is routinely run to poll for change, the $SENDER variable will in this case hold the value routine.When an item invokes a script, the script has access to some environment variables, such as:$NAME$SENDER$CONFIG\_DIRWhere $NAME is the name of the item that has invoked the script and $SENDER is the reason why the script is executed.
The variable $CONFIG\_DIR contains the absolute path of the directory where the current sketchybarrc file is located.If an item is clicked the script has access to the additional variables:$BUTTON$MODIFIERwhere the $BUTTON can be left, right or other and specifies the mouse button that was used to click the item, while the $MODIFIER is either shift, ctrl, alt or cmd and
specifies the modifier key held down while clicking the item.If an item receive a scroll event from the mouse the script gets send the additional $SCROLL\_DELTA variable.All scripts are forced to terminate after 60 seconds and do not run while the system is sleeping. Creating custom events​This allows to define events which are triggered by arbitrary applications or manually (see Trigger custom events).
Items can also subscribe to these events for their script execution.sketchybar --add event  [optional: ]Optional: You can subscribe to the notifications sent to the NSDistributedNotificationCenter e.g.
the notification Spotify sends on track change:
com.spotify.client.PlaybackStateChanged (example), or the
notification sent by the system when the screen is unlocked:
com.apple.screenIsUnlocked (example)
to create more responsive items.
Custom events that subscribe to NSDistributedNotificationCenter notifications
will receive additional notification information in the $INFO variable if available.
For more NSDistributedNotifications see this discussion.Triggering custom events​This triggers a custom event that has been added beforesketchybar --trigger  [Optional: = ... =]Optionally you can add environment variables to the trigger command witch are passed to the script, e.g.:sketchybar --trigger demo VAR=Testwill trigger the demo event and $VAR will be available as an environment variable in the scripts that this event invokes.Forcing all shell scripts to run and the bar to refresh​This command forces all scripts to run and all events to be emitted, it should
never be used in an item script, as this would lead to infinite loops. It
is prominently needed after the initial configuration to properly initialize
all items by forcing all their scripts to runsketchybar --updatePreviousPopup MenusNextQuerying InformationEvents and ScriptingCreating custom eventsTriggering custom eventsForcing all shell scripts to run and the bar to refresh
