SetupOn this pageSetupInstallation​Prerequisite​SketchyBar will only work properly with the system setting "Displays have
separate Spaces" turned on (the default setting). The option is located
in System Settings -> Desktop & Dock -> Displays have separate Spaces.Brew Install​brew tap FelixKratz/formulaebrew install sketchybarCopy the example configuration and make it executable:mkdir -p ~/.config/sketchybar/pluginscp $(brew --prefix)/share/sketchybar/examples/sketchybarrc ~/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrccp -r $(brew --prefix)/share/sketchybar/examples/plugins/ ~/.config/sketchybar/plugins/The default configuration is intentionally sparse, so if you are looking for something more sophisticated as a starting point, you might want to look at
this discussion.Run the bar automatically at startup:brew services start sketchybaror in the command line with verbose output:sketchybarIt is possible to run sketchybar with a custom config file path (i.e. something
else than $HOME/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc) via:sketchybar --config Fonts​The default sketchybar font is the Hack Nerd Font:brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-fontif you experience missing icons you might need to install it. Any font
of your liking can be used in sketchybar.If you want to load fonts from a non standard directory, you can usesketchybar --load-font to load a font file from any .Plugins​When you use/create additional plugins, make sure that they are made executable viachmod +x name/of/plugin.shIf you run sketchybar from the command line directly with the command sketchybar you will see
all outputs and error messages from your scripts.The default plugin folder is located in ~/.config/sketchybar/plugins.
Plugins need to be referenced with absolute paths because relative paths will not be resolved correctly.
Have a look at the discussion for plugins and share your own if you want to.
You should of course vet the code from all plugins before executing them to make sure they are not harming your computer.Hiding the original macOS bar​(Pre macOS Ventura) Hide the default macOS menu bar in System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar:
(macOS Ventura) Hide the default macOS menu bar in System Settings -> Desktop & Dock -> Automatically hide and show the menu bar -> Always:
(macOS Sonoma) Hide the default macOS menu bar in System Settings -> Control Center -> Automatically hide and show the menu bar -> Always:
