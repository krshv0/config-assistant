ConfigurationBar PropertiesOn this pageBar PropertiesConfiguration of the barâ€‹For an example configuration see the supplied default sketchybarrc.
The configuration file resides in ~/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc and is a
regular script that gets executed when SketchyBar launches, everything
persistent should be set up in this script.It is possible to play with properties in the commandline and change
them on the fly while the bar is running, once you find a fitting
value you can include it in the sketchybarrc file, such that the configuration
is restored on restart. When configuring SketchyBar it can be helpful to stop
the brew service and run sketchybar from the commandline directly to see all
relevant error messages and warnings directly.The global bar properties can be configured by invoking:sketchybar --bar = ... =where possible settings are:defaultdescriptioncolor0x44000000Color of the barborder\_color0xffff0000Color of the bars borderpositiontop, bottomtopPosition of the bar on the screenheight25Height of the barnotch\_display\_height0Override of the height of the bar on notched displaysmargin0Margin around the bary\_offset0Vertical offset of the bar from its default positioncorner\_radius0Corner radius of the barborder\_width0Border width of the bars borderblur\_radius0Blur radius applied to the background of the barpadding\_left0Padding between the left bar border and the leftmost itempadding\_right0Padding between the right bar border and the rightmost itemnotch\_width200The width of the notch to be accounted for on the internal displaynotch\_offset0Additional y\_offset exclusively applied to notched screensdisplaymain, all, allDisplay to show the bar onhidden, currentoffIf all / the current bar is hiddentopmost, windowoffIf the bar should be drawn on top of everything, or on top of all windowsstickyonMakes the bar sticky during space changesfont\_smoothingoffIf fonts should be smoothenedshadowoffIf the bar should draw a shadowYou can find the nomenclature for all the types here.
