ConfigurationItem PropertiesOn this pageItem PropertiesItems and their properties​Items are the main building blocks of SketchyBar and can be configured in a number of ways. Items have the following basic structure:Adding items to SketchyBar​sketchybar --add item  where the  should not contain whitespaces (or must be quoted), it is later used to refer to this item in the configuration.
The  is the placement in the bar and can be either left, right, center or q (which is left of the notch) and e (which is right of the notch).
The items will appear in the bar in the order in which they are added, but can be moved later on.left, right, center, (q, e #120)Changing item properties​sketchybar --set  = ... =where the  is used to target the item.

All item created after changing the defaults will
inherit these properties from the default item.sketchybar --default = ... =this works for all item properties.Item Reordering​It is possible to reorder items by invokingsketchybar --reorder  ... where a new order can be supplied for arbitrary items. Only the specified items get reordered, by swapping them around, everything else stays the same. E.g. if you want to swap two items
simply callsketchybar --reorder  Moving Items to specific positions​It is possible to move items and order them next to a reference item.Move Item  to appear before item :sketchybar --move  before Move Item  to appear after item :sketchybar --move  after Item Cloning​It is possible to clone another item instead of adding a completely blank itemsketchybar --clone   [optional: before/after]the new item will inherit all properties of the parent item. The optional before and after modifiers can be used
to move the item before, or after the parent, equivalently to a --move command.Renaming Items​It is possible to rename any item. The new name should obviously not be in use by another item:sketchybar --rename  Removing Items​It is possible to remove any item by invoking, the item will be completely destroyed and removed from brackets sketchybar --remove the  can again be a regex: //.PreviousBar PropertiesNextSpecial ComponentsItems and their propertiesAdding items to SketchyBarChanging item propertiesGeometry PropertiesIcon propertiesLabel propertiesScripting propertiesText propertiesBackground propertiesImage propertiesShadow propertiesChanging the default values for all further itemsItem ReorderingMoving Items to specific positionsItem CloningRenaming ItemsRemoving Items
